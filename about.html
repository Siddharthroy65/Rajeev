  <h1 class="about">What Is Photography?</h1>
 <p> Photography is the whole world full of adventures, interesting events, stories, games of colors and light. As one of the most interesting and exciting forms of art, it appeared a long time ago, and to this time has been greatly influencing the human life. In the 19th century, for example, the adherents of positivism believed that photography is a science that allows to record reality. Photography, both art and science, has constantly been improved by different artists, inventors, scientists, and engineers. </p>
       <h2 class="about"> The Actual Value of a Photograph</h2>

  <p>In addition to representing reality, photography is also important in other areas of human life.
     For example, in the world of commerce, a photograph can play a key role in
     influencing consumers or clients or forming the reputation of a particular brand or company.
      Photographs have a huge emotional impact on people, making them experience particular sort of
       emotion, so that they have a certain desire to buy something, go somewhere, or look in a certain way.
        This can be especially observed in the case when women want to be similar to models in advertising and
        buy hundreds of goods. Television and the internet have been using it for decades, and believe me, do not lose</p>

         <p> The value of the image is determined by its color, its uniqueness, charm, and also practical meaning. If the power of the photograph is so great, that it can make people think over something, or compare or connect themselves with the objects depicted on it, it is regarded as a very valuable thing.
            We need to remember, that every image has a story to tell, and it shouldn’t be neglected.</p>

            <h3 class="about">Photograph as a Powerful Weapon</h3>
             <p> To take a good photograph, a person doesn’t need to put much effort. He or she only has to find the perfect light, background and add a little creativity. But depending on a target audience, you will need to take into account some more aspects. For some people, the shooting time or locations would be enough to make a conclusion on the photograph. To sum up, different people see the photographs in different ways.

Very often, a photograph is a powerful weapon to influence groups of people. As mentioned previously, you do not always know the truth behind a photograph. Therefore, many photographers take the use of it to control the vulnerable people. In addition, people with different ideologies interpret images in their own ways and sometimes may not understand the meaning well. For instance, if you want to grab attention from particular people, you can try to make the image cause shock, aggression, sadness, stress, or uncertainty. Such incidences have already happened more than once in the real world, and especially during the Lebanon war period. This is a warning to all people to be careful and unbiased when viewing photos and videos in the media</p>

<p>Photography is the process of creating still or moving pictures by recording radiation on a sensitive medium like film or an electronic sensor. The products of photography are called negatives and photographs, the latter being developed from the negatives. Light patterns reflected or emitted by objects activate a sensitive chemical or electronic sensor during a timed exposure usually through a photographic lens in a camera. The camera stores the resulting information chemically or electronically.</p>
<p>Photographers control the camera and lens to expose the light recording material to the required amount of light to form a latent image (on film) or raw file (in digital camera) which, after due processing, is converted to a usable image. In digital cameras, instead of film, an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive devices is used.

Photography can also be called an art and good photographers often exhibit their oeuvre like artists exhibit their paintings. In fact, the Greek word for photography means ‘drawing with light’. Photography has many applications in business, science and filmmaking, fashion, tourism, advertising, etc.</p>
